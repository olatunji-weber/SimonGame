# SimonGame
This repository was created to practice making a game called Simon game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, 
with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

The essense of the game is to aid in training the memory to be much better developed by whoever plays the game over time.
